# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLS (Ã  la bit.ly).

TinyApp also allows you to monitor your social media reach by tracking clicks to your link as well as unique visitors.

## Final Product

You can use the shortened links even if you're not logged in. But to make a new one or manipulate any existing ones, you must be register and be logged in.
